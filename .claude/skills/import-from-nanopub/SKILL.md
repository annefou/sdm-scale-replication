description: Seed Phase 1 of a fresh replication from a published nanopub URI instead of (or alongside) a paper PDF. Fetches every reachable nanopub in the chain — CiTO Citation, Research Synthesis, all chain steps, all sibling chains — and produces `nanopubs/imported/CHAIN_SUMMARY.md` summarising what's already been tested by whom, with what scope/method, and with what Outcome. Use when the new replication extends, qualifies, or builds on existing FORRT chains on the network.

# /import-from-nanopub

You're seeding Phase 1 of this replication from a **published nanopub URI** instead of (or in addition to) a paper PDF. The typical entry point is a CiTO Citation or a Research Synthesis nanopub at the apex of an existing chain; from that one URI the whole constellation is reachable by traversing CiTO citations and provenance links.

This skill produces a structured summary that the `paper-analyst` agent (and the human running the replication) can read as if it were `00_paper_summary.md`, except it summarises **prior signed claims about the upstream paper**, not the paper itself.

## When to use this skill

- **Extending an existing chain.** Same upstream paper, new dataset / method / region. You want to see what's already been claimed so the new chain can `extends` prior work via CiTO instead of duplicating it.
- **Replacing or qualifying a contradicted chain.** Prior work disputed the upstream paper; you want to re-test under different conditions.
- **Awareness-check before fresh replication.** Same upstream paper; you want to confirm there is no near-duplicate already on the network.
- **Constellation entry point.** Given a Research Synthesis URI, you want to expand it back into its constituent Outcome / Study / Claim / AIDA / Quote chain steps.

## When NOT to use

- Your replication has no relationship to existing FORRT chains on the network — use the paper-rooted Phase 1 (`paper-analyst` agent on a PDF) instead.
- The entry URI is from outside the Science Live / nanopub network (a Wikidata item, a Zenodo DOI). The skill is nanopub-network-specific.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Get the entry URI

Ask the user for the entry URI. Acceptable forms:

- `https://w3id.org/sciencelive/np/RA...` (Science Live)
- `https://w3id.org/np/RA...` (Nanodash / nanopub network)

Reject URIs that don't match this pattern with a helpful message — this skill is nanopub-network-specific.

### Step 2 — Verify the URI actually resolves

Before running the full crawl, sanity-check the entry URI exists. Open it in the Science Live viewer:

```
https://w3id.org/sciencelive/np/RA...  → opens the viewer with Template View / RDF View tabs
```

…or fetch its TriG:

```bash
curl -s -L -H "Accept: application/trig" "<URI>" | head -50
```

If the response is empty or 404, stop. Tell the user: *"That URI does not resolve. Common reasons: (1) typo in the URI, (2) the nanopub was retracted, (3) network issue. Verify in the Science Live viewer first."* See `feedback_nanopub_uri_verification.md` in the user's auto-memory — `PUBLISHED.md` files are not always exhaustive, but the viewer is authoritative.

### Step 3 — Run the importer script

```bash
python3 scripts/import-nanopub-chain.py <ENTRY-URI>
```

What this does, in two layers:

**Claim-layer import** (the "what was published" axis):

- BFS-walks the citation + provenance graph via SPARQL queries (`scripts/queries/`) against `https://query.knowledgepixels.com/repo/full` and fetches every reachable nanopub (default depth 5, default cap 80 nodes).
- Caches each fetched TriG to `nanopubs/imported/trig/<RA-id>.trig`.
- Writes `nanopubs/imported/constellation.json` — structured graph: nodes (URI → step type → key fields) + edges (CiTO + provenance relations).
- Writes `nanopubs/imported/cited_papers.txt` — external (non-nanopub) URIs, typically the upstream paper DOI(s).

**Infrastructure-layer inheritance** (the "what was built" axis):

- Scans each Outcome / Research Software nanopub for a `hasOutcomeRepository` URI (which may be either a GitHub URL or a Zenodo DOI — both are handled; Zenodo DOIs are resolved to GitHub URLs via Zenodo's `related_identifiers` API).
- **`git clone`s each sibling repository** into `--siblings-dir` (default `../`, matching the convention of keeping related replication repos as filesystem siblings).
- Copies a curated set of starter files from the first cloned sibling into `_template_from_prior/` (`--staging-dir`): `pixi.toml`, `pixi.lock`, `Snakefile`, `notebooks/01_data_download.py`, `notebooks/02_data_clean.py`, `Dockerfile`. Each file gets a provenance header.
- Writes `nanopubs/imported/SETUP_INHERITED.md` documenting which sibling URLs were resolved, where they were cloned, which files were staged, and what to do with them.

To disable the infrastructure layer (claim-only import), pass `--no-inherit`. To skip cloning but still attempt inheritance from already-present sibling clones, pass `--no-clone-siblings`.

Network access is required. The script is dependency-light: stdlib + `rdflib` + `git`. If `rdflib` is missing, the script prints a clear error; install with `pip install rdflib` in the same env you run the other replication scripts in.

If the user has no network (e.g. air-gapped HPC), they should run this step on a different machine and copy the `nanopubs/imported/` directory across (note: `_template_from_prior/` and sibling clones live outside `nanopubs/imported/` and need separate transfer).

### Step 4 — Read constellation.json and the cached TriG

Open `nanopubs/imported/constellation.json` and inspect:

- `entry` — the URI the user gave you
- `node_count` / `edge_count` — sanity check (typical FORRT chain: 6–8 nodes single-chain; 18–25 multi-chain constellation)
- `nodes[]` — each fetched nanopub with `step_type`, `cito_relations`, `prov_derived_from`, `plain_text_excerpts` (heuristically-extracted human-readable strings)
- `edges[]` — CiTO and provenance relations between nodes
- `external_citations` — upstream paper DOIs

For each interesting node, also read the cached TriG at `node.raw_trig_path`. The script's heuristic `step_type` classification is good but not infallible; the cached TriG is the ground truth. Look at the Assertion graph for the substantive content (verbatim Quote text, AIDA sentence, Claim type + statement, Outcome verdict, etc.).

### Step 5 — Generate `CHAIN_SUMMARY.md`

Write `nanopubs/imported/CHAIN_SUMMARY.md`. Structure it as the *prior-work analogue* of `nanopubs/drafts/00_paper_summary.md`:

```markdown
# Prior FORRT chain summary

**Entry URI**: <entry_uri>
**Imported on**: <ISO date>
**Constellation size**: <N> unique nanopubs across <K> chain(s)

## Upstream paper

<DOI(s) and resolved title — extract title from TriG dct:title if present;
otherwise leave for the user to fill in. Cite the paper DOI verbatim.>

## Chain(s) already published

For each chain found in the constellation:

### Chain <ID> — <short label, derived from authors/Study text>

| Step | Template | URI | Key content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Quote-with-comment | RA... | "<verbatim Quote text>" |
| 02 | AIDA | RA... | "<AIDA sentence>" |
| 03 | FORRT Claim | RA... | type=<claim type>, statement="..." |
| 04 | FORRT Replication Study | RA... | scope="...", method="..." |
| 05 | FORRT Replication Outcome | RA... | verdict=<Validated/PartiallySupported/Contradicted>, "..." |
| 06 | CiTO Citation | RA... | cito:<relation> → <upstream paper DOI> |
| 07 | Research Software | RA... | <if present> |

Authors (ORCIDs): <list>

### Apex Research Synthesis (if present)

URI: RA...
Aggregates: <chain-IDs>
Synthesis verdict: "..."

### Synthesis-level CiTO (if present)

URI: RA...
Relation: cito:<relation> → upstream paper DOI
Statement: "..."

## What this new replication can do

Given prior chains, the new replication's natural positioning:

- If a prior chain `confirms` and the new replication tests a different
  taxon / region / horizon → new chain's CiTO will `extends` prior chain
  via CiTO `cito:extends` to one of prior CiTO URIs.
- If a prior chain `qualifies` and the new replication might either
  reinforce or contradict the qualifying finding → new CiTO is either
  `cito:confirms` (qualifies the qualification — note this in the CiTO
  "personal comment" field) or `cito:disputes`.
- If no prior chain exists for the dimension the new replication tests →
  fresh sibling chain, CiTO relation as appropriate to the new Outcome
  verdict (`confirms` / `qualifies` / `disputes` / `extends` upstream paper).

## Methodological precedents to inherit

- Scope and method definitions in prior Replication Study nanopubs — read
  these before drafting `nanopubs/drafts/04_study.md` to ensure
  comparability where intended.
- Limitation declarations in prior Replication Outcome nanopubs — these
  flag deviations the prior authors had to make; your replication may
  hit the same constraints.

## Open questions for the user

<List 3-5 specific questions about how the new replication should position
relative to the prior constellation. These typically include:>

- Will the new replication `extends` the canonical chain's CiTO, or open
  a fresh chain rooted on the upstream paper?
- Are there prior Research Software nanopubs whose toolchain we should
  reuse (mark as cited via CiTO `cito:usesMethodIn`)?
- Does the prior Synthesis already cover the case we're testing? If so,
  do we add a new chain or extend the existing Synthesis?
```

Keep the summary **factual and short**. Do not editorialise. The user (and
the `paper-analyst` agent that runs next) will read this to position the new
replication.

### Step 6 — Hand off to Phase 1 + persist only the URI

After `CHAIN_SUMMARY.md` is written, tell the user:

> *"Imported `<N>` nanopubs from the constellation rooted at `<entry-URI>`. Summary at `nanopubs/imported/CHAIN_SUMMARY.md` (local cache — **gitignored, do NOT commit**).*
>
> *The persistent pointer to this prior chain is the entry URI itself, which should be added to `CITATION.cff` `references:` as a `type: generic` entry with `url:` set to the URI. That way anyone cloning the repo can regenerate the local cache by re-running `/import-from-nanopub <URI>` — the nanopub network is the single source of truth, not a committed snapshot.*
>
> *Open questions are listed at the bottom of `CHAIN_SUMMARY.md` — answer those before drafting any nanopubs. Then either: (a) place the upstream paper PDF at `paper/<name>.pdf` and run the `paper-analyst` agent in Phase 1 with `CHAIN_SUMMARY.md` as the prior-work context, or (b) skip directly to Phase 2 if the new replication is a pure method-extension of a prior chain and doesn't need fresh paper analysis."*

**The cache is gitignored on purpose.** Nanopubs are immutable on the network and identified by their URI. Mirroring them into each replication repo creates inconsistency risk (the local snapshot can diverge from the live network) and bloats repos with derived data. The persistent contract is the URI in `CITATION.cff`; the cache is ephemeral.

### Step 7 — Hand off the infrastructure-inheritance staging area

If `SETUP_INHERITED.md` reports that files were copied to `_template_from_prior/`, also tell the user:

> *"The infrastructure-layer inheritance has staged `<N>` starter files at `_template_from_prior/`, copied from the canonical sibling chain. These include `pixi.toml`, `pixi.lock`, `Snakefile`, and `notebooks/01_data_download.py` — read the SETUP_INHERITED.md table for the full list and provenance. **Review each staged file, merge with your own at the corresponding path, then delete `_template_from_prior/`.** This staging directory is a one-shot reference area, NOT durable repo state. Do not commit it."*
>
> *If you opted out of cloning (`--no-clone-siblings`) or no `hasOutcomeRepository` URIs were found in the imported nanopubs, the staging area is empty and only the resolved URLs appear in `SETUP_INHERITED.md` for your reference.*

## Failure modes

- **Empty constellation (0 nodes fetched)** — entry URI didn't resolve, or the BFS hit a non-Science-Live URI immediately. Re-verify the entry URI via Step 2.
- **Crawl hits the node cap (≥ max-nodes)** — the constellation is larger than expected; either bump `--max-nodes 200` or narrow the entry URI to a more specific point in the chain.
- **All `step_type = "Unknown"`** — the template-URI heuristics in the script didn't match. Read the TriG manually and infer step types; if a new template family is being used, extend `STEP_TYPE_HINTS` in `scripts/import-nanopub-chain.py`.
- **Verbatim text excerpts are short / cryptic** — the heuristic `extract_plain_text` returns the longest literals first, but for some nanopubs the substantive content is in `rdfs:label` of nested entities. Open the cached TriG and read manually.
- **Cycle in the citation graph** — the BFS uses a `visited` set so cycles are not a hazard, but `prov:wasDerivedFrom` chains can be long; if the BFS feels slow, lower `--depth`.
- **`Could not resolve <Zenodo DOI> to a GitHub URL`** — the Zenodo record's `related_identifiers` don't include a GitHub link. Common in older deposits; the user can manually add the GitHub URL to the prior chain's CITATION.cff via a separate commit, or just visit the Zenodo page and clone the linked repo manually.
- **`git clone failed`** — repo is private, network down, or rate-limited. Fall back to `--no-clone-siblings` and tell the user to clone manually.
- **Inherited file conflicts** — `_template_from_prior/` files start fresh each import. If you re-run with different siblings, prior staging is overwritten. Don't store work-in-progress edits in `_template_from_prior/`.
